When the excess generation is credited at the same rate as the customer’s consumption, it’s known as net metering (in Texas, 1:1 Buyback plans are similar to this). Net Metering ensures solar homeowners receive equal credit for the electricity their solar array generates and helps them see a return on their investment in solar. <strong>Thirty-eight states require utilities to offer net metering. Texas isn’t one of them.</strong> <br><br> If you buy electricity from a Retail Electricity Provider in Texas, your solar savings will depend on which plan you choose. In turn, the best plan depends on these factors, which vary from household to household: <div class=\"list\"><ul><li>how much of your daily electricity needs are served by your solar array versus imported from the grid</li> <li>how much surplus electricity your solar array exports to the grid</li><li> what times of day you use electricity </li> </ul></div> Scroll down to see how these factors could play out during a typical day.","steps":[{"step":"1","text":"Your electric bill depends on how much of your daily electricity is <strong>imported</strong> from the grid versus <strong>generated</strong> by your home solar array."},{"step":"2","text":"The light gray bars represent your electricity <strong>usage</strong> each hour throughout a typical day."},{"step":"3","text":"A solar array will generate electricity during daylight hours. <br><br> The dark gray bars show how much electricity is <strong>generated</strong> per hour throughout the day.
