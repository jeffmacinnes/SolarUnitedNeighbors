{"title":"An inquiry concerning human obfuscation","subtitle":"Oh yeah, and there's a lot to be said on this topic","intro":"\r\n\r\nColony Eight on the Damballa was a huddle of low plastic domes set in a clearing of the jungle. It was also the most welcome sight Jim Reese had seen in a month—the month since he'd quarreled with Lois and struck out into the jungle alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had covered close to a thousand miles—all the way to Colony Seven, the nearest of the 10 colonies Earth had planted on the jungle world. Now he was returning, hoping his month's absence had healed the wounds he and Lois had caused each other. She had had time to think things over. So had he—and he still loved her.","conclusion":"The alien whirled uncertainly and fixed his bleary green eyes on Reese. \"Trouble, Earthman,\" he wheezed. \"Go away. Away. Big trouble.\"\r\nReese frowned. \"What are you talking about?\"\r\nKuhli came near and rocked unsteadily on the pads of his seven-toed feet. \"Everyone crazy there. Not safe. Trouble, Earthman.\" He moaned softly to himself. \"Sad things happening.\"\r\nReese glared at the alien; grasped him by his scaly shoulders and shook him. \"Speak up, Kuhli! Is this just another pipedream of yours or is there something wrong in the Colony? I have to know!\"\r\nThe alien whined piteously. \"Don't hurt Kuhli. Don't hurt. Trouble, Earthman!\"\r\nReese noticed a pack slung over the creature's back. \"What's in here?\"\r\n\"Mine! Mine! Don't touch!\"\r\nCuriosity impelled Reese to turn the alien around and peer in the bulging pack while the old man gibbered in fear."}
