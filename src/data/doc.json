Investing in local energy solutions like rooftop solar improves the reliability of the Texas energy grid but without state incentives or a statewide net metering policy, many consumers who want solar don’t know where to start or what adding solar means for their utility bills. The economics of rooftop solar varies dramatically, based upon customer-selected rate plans from competitive energy retailers, a fixture of Texas’s unique, deregulated electricity market."},{"type":"text","value":"In the last year using Smart Meter Texas data, we’ve analyzed the energy usage and energy production patterns of <strong>more than 300 Texas solar owners</strong> and compared them to available retail electricity plans in their area.

When the excess generation is credited at the same rate as the customer’s consumption this is known as net metering. It ensures solar homeowners receive fair credit for the electricity their systems generate and helps them see a return on their investment into solar. Net metering policies are enacted at the state level. <strong>Thirty-eight states require utilities to offer net-metering. Texas is not one of them.</strong> <br><br> If you buy electricity from a Retail Electricity Provider in Texas, the plan you choose will impact your solar savings as will these factors which vary from household to household: when your home is using the most electricity, how much of your daily electricity needs are served by your solar system versus imported from the grid, and how much electricity your system is exporting to the grid. <br><br>Scroll down to see how these factors could play out during a typical day.","steps":[{"step":"1","text":"Your electrical bill depends on how much of your daily electricity is <strong>imported</strong> from the grid versus <strong>generated</strong> with a home solar system."},{"step":"2","text":"The light gray bars represent your electricity <strong>usage</strong> each hour throughout a typical day."},{"step":"3","text":"A solar system will generate electricity during daylight hours. <br><br> The dark gray bars show how much electricity is <strong>generated</strong> per hour throughout the day."},{"step":"4","text":"Solar generation will reduce the amount of electricity imported from the grid. <br><br> The circles show your <strong>net energy</strong> (usage - generation) at each hour, and represent how much electricity is needed from the grid."},{"step":"6","text":"<strong>Without</strong> any solar generation, all of your electricity is <strong>imported</strong> from the grid."},{"step":"7","text":"<strong>With</strong> a large solar array, you might generate more electricity than you use during portions of the day. <br><br> The excess energy is <strong>exported</strong> back to the grid, and - with solar buyback plans - you can earn money for this."}]},"section3":{"section":"Compare plans","subtitle":"Find the best plan type to fit your needs","overview":"When you adjust the different factors impacting solar savings--your overall electricity demand, when your home uses the most electricity, and how much electricity your solar system generates--the analysis tool will show you what plan type is most likely to be the best.","sliderToolTips":[{"homeSize":"How much energy you are using from the utility each month depends on a number of factors like how big your home is, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there, and your consumption habits.
